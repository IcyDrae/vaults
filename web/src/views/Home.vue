      <h1>How to get started...</h1>
      <div class="step">
        <p>- Sign up using a unique, long and hard to guess password. <br> This is called the master password and it's the key to all your data.
          Keep this secure at all times as it is not recoverable and you cannot change it.</p>

      </div>
      <div class="step">
        <p>- Create one or multiple vaults. You can have a personal vault and a vault for work-only accounts or however you wish.</p>
      </div>
      <div class="step">
        <p>- Create a login for a website and fill in your data, generating a secure password for it on demand.
        You can also create notes and use them for your other important things such as bank cards, memberships, etc.</p>
      </div>

        <p>Remember, your vault and all the items you put inside it get encrypted everytime before leaving your device & getting stored on our servers;
          ensuring only you know what you have stored, and only you can decrypt it using your master password!</p>
